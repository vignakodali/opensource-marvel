# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to our repository! If you're looking to contribute, you're in the right place. This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to contribute to our project, including explanations of key concepts like Pull Requests (PRs) and code reviews, as well as a step-by-step process for making contributions.

## Understanding Pull Requests and Code Reviews

### What is a Pull Request (PR)?

A Pull Request is a method used in version control systems to introduce changes to the repository. After you make changes in a branch of your fork, you can issue a PR. This is essentially a request to the repository maintainers to pull your changes into the official project. PRs are a pivotal component of collaborative development, allowing for discussion and review of code before it integrates into the main codebase.

### What is a Code Review?

A code review is a part of the PR process where other contributors and maintainers review your code. This practice ensures quality and consistency in the codebase and is a perfect opportunity to get feedback on your coding decisions. Code reviews help catch bugs, ensure best practices, and maintain the overall health of the codebase.

## Contributing to the Project

Follow these steps to contribute to our project:

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository. This creates a copy of the repo under your GitHub account, which is your private workspace where you can make changes without affecting the original project.

### Step 2: Create a Feature Branch

1. Clone your fork to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
2. Navigate into the cloned directory::
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
3. Create a new branch for your feature::
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name

### Step 3: Make Changes
Make the required changes in your feature branch. If you have your development environment setup properly, eslint will run and ensure your code passes all rules before your commits are accepted.

### Step 4: Push Changes and Create a Pull Request
1. Push your changes to your fork::
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch-name
2. Go to your fork on GitHub and click "New Pull Request".
3. Set the base repository's sandbox branch as the base branch and your feature branch as the compare branch.
4. Fill in the details of the pull request and submit it.

# Final Steps
Once your PR is submitted, it will be reviewed by our Team. Participate in the discussion and make any required changes. Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the sandbox branch for further integration testing before it becomes part of the main project.
